ENHANCING THE RELIABILITY OF OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION IMAGE DETECTION IN NEURAL NETWORKS

We propose a simple and effective method, ODIN(Out-of-Distribution detector for Neural Networks),
for detecting out-of-distribution examples in neural networks. Our method does net require
re-training the neural network and is easily implementable on any modern neural architecture.
